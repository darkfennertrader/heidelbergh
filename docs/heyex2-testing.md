# HEYEX 2 Testing Windows EC2

This document captures the state of the dedicated Windows EC2 instance that hosts a
test install of Heidelberg **HEYEX 2** (Spectralis PACS / workstation software). It is
used to exercise the **customer side** of the AppWay pipeline end-to-end from our own
AWS account — i.e. push a DICOM from HEYEX 2 → watch AppWay pick it up → verify the
`result.dcm` returned by `appway-worker` lands back in HEYEX 2.

See also:
- `docs/appway.md` — the production **Solution-side** Windows EC2 that runs AppWay Link.
- `docs/backend.md` — the Linux backend worker that receives jobs via SQS.
- `docs/heyex2/` — Heidelberg's official HEYEX 2 manuals.

---

## Purpose

The original end-to-end validation needed a HEYEX 2 deployment at a real clinic to
actually trigger jobs. To shorten the feedback loop and avoid bothering real ophthalmologists
during integration testing, we now have our own HEYEX 2 instance inside AWS:

- Lives in the same region / VPC as the rest of the AppWay infrastructure.
- Can be stopped between test sessions to save on cost.
- Accessible via RDP (for the HEYEX 2 GUI) and via AWS SSM (for headless automation / log
  gathering from this repo).

It is **not** a production machine and should **never** hold real patient data. Only
fully pseudonymized / synthetic DICOMs allowed.

### Noteworthy running services (first snapshot)

Nothing HEYEX-related is installed yet — it's a vanilla Windows Server 2019 baseline
with the usual Microsoft services running. Key services visible:

- `AmazonSSMAgent` (Amazon SSM Agent)
- `TermService` + `UmRdpService` + `SessionEnv` (Remote Desktop)
- `WinRM` (remote PowerShell)
- `Schedule` (Task Scheduler — useful if we want cron-like behaviour later)
- `WinDefend` + `WdNisSvc` + `mpssvc` (Windows Defender + Firewall)
- `Winmgmt` (WMI)

HEYEX 2, the AppWay Link, the publisher/result-consumer relays, Python, .NET ≥ 4.8,
SQL Server etc. are **not** installed yet.

---

## Remote-Access Setup

### 1. IAM / SSM — for headless automation from this repo

On 2026-04-30 the instance was launched **without** an IAM instance profile, which
prevented SSM from managing it. Fixed by creating and attaching a dedicated role:

- **Role name:** `EC2Heyex2TestingRole`
- **Attached managed policy:** `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` (AWS-managed)
- **Attached via:** EC2 Console → Instances → Heyex2-testing → Actions → Security → Modify IAM role

After attaching the role, the SSM Agent did not auto-detect the new credentials on a
running Windows instance. It had to be restarted manually. Inside the machine (via
RDP, Command Prompt):

```cmd
net stop AmazonSSMAgent && net start AmazonSSMAgent
```

Once restarted, the instance registered with SSM within ~30 seconds. Verified from
the backend EC2:

```bash
aws ssm describe-instance-information \
  --filters "Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02a7dd1797d85a099"
# → PingStatus: Online
```

> **Lesson learned.** When launching a future Windows test instance, attach the IAM
> profile **at launch time** so SSM works immediately without a restart dance.
> If you launch without one and attach it later, you have to manually
> `net stop / net start AmazonSSMAgent` to pick up the new credentials.

### 2. RDP — for the HEYEX 2 GUI

Standard Windows RDP on port 3389. Use the `AppWay` key pair to decrypt the
Administrator password from the EC2 Console:

```
EC2 Console → Instances → Heyex2-testing → Connect → RDP client
→ Get password → paste AppWay.pem → reveal password
```

Then from any RDP client:

- Host: `54.154.242.69` (or the current Elastic IP if one is later associated)
- User: `Administrator`
- Password: (decrypted from the console)

### 3. SSM Session Manager — interactive shell without RDP

For quick shell access without opening port 3389:

```bash
aws ssm start-session --target i-02a7dd1797d85a099
```

Opens a PowerShell session on the Windows machine, tunneled through AWS — no RDP
port exposure needed.

---

## Running Commands from the Backend EC2

The backend EC2 role (`EC2AppWayBackendRole`) already carries
`ssm:SendCommand` / `ssm:GetCommandInvocation` on the production AppWay Windows
instance. The Heyex2-testing instance is covered by the same permissions because
they live in the same AWS account — nothing extra was needed in the backend role's
inline policy.

Shortcut helper already in the repo: `scripts/ssm_run.py` — pass the target
instance ID and a PowerShell snippet. Example:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/appway-backend
uv run python scripts/ssm_run.py \
  --instance-id i-02a7dd1797d85a099 \
  --ps "Get-Service AmazonSSMAgent | Format-List *"
```

Or a raw one-liner with the AWS CLI:

```bash
CID=$(aws ssm send-command \
  --instance-ids i-02a7dd1797d85a099 \
  --document-name "AWS-RunPowerShellScript" \
  --parameters 'commands=["hostname; whoami"]' \
  --query 'Command.CommandId' --output text)

sleep 3
aws ssm get-command-invocation --command-id "$CID" \
  --instance-id i-02a7dd1797d85a099 --query 'StandardOutputContent' --output text
```

---

## IAM Policies Required on the Backend EC2 Role

Nothing new was needed to talk to this machine. The existing backend role already
allows:

- `ssm:SendCommand` / `ssm:GetCommandInvocation` / `ssm:ListCommandInvocations`
  on `arn:aws:ec2:eu-west-1:*:instance/*` (wildcard across all instances in the account).
- `ec2:DescribeInstances` / `ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus`.

Confirmed end-to-end with command id `9d15309d-8505-4b3c-be9a-af1023823d0f`
(status `Success`, `ResponseCode: 0`).

**What the backend role is still NOT allowed to do** (by design — least privilege):

- `iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies`, `iam:Get*` — cannot inspect IAM roles at all.
- `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`, `ec2:DescribeVpcEndpoints` — cannot see network config.

These omissions do not block any Heyex2-testing workflow we care about; they just
mean security-group / VPC troubleshooting has to happen in the AWS Console or from a
machine with wider IAM access.

See the **Next Steps** section below for what has to happen before this machine can
actually push a test DICOM into AppWay.

---

## Next Steps (to make this machine useful)

1. **Install HEYEX 2 prerequisites**
   - Microsoft SQL Server (edition per Heidelberg's manual — `docs/heyex2/Ashvins_HEYEX_2.6.2_EN_IT_and_Hardware_Requirements.pdf`).
   - .NET Framework ≥ 4.8 (should already be present on Windows Server 2019).
   - IIS if required.
2. **Install HEYEX 2 itself**
   - Use the Heidelberg installer provided by MedicalCommunications.
   - User manual: `docs/heyex2/Ashvins_HEYEX_2.6.2_EN_User_Manual.pdf`.
3. **Install the AppWay Link client**
   - Same binary used on the production AppWay Windows EC2 (`docs/appway.md`).
   - Needs the customer private key issued by Heidelberg for the test environment.
4. **Install our publisher / result-consumer relays** (if this machine is meant to
   also act as the customer-side bridge — *probably not*: its job is to simulate
   HEYEX, not AppWay Link).
5. **Configure DICOM AE titles / ports** so HEYEX 2 can push to AppWay Link and
   receive the result object back from it.
6. **Smoke test** — push a test OPT volume from HEYEX 2, watch it land in
   `s3://appway-bridge-prod/incoming/`, and verify HEYEX 2 eventually receives the
   `result.dcm` back.

Each of these steps will be added to this document (with command snippets,
screenshots if needed, and dated verification entries) as they are completed — same
format as `docs/appway.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### ① WebView2 "can't reach this page" when clicking a result tile

**Symptom:** After a successful AppWay job the result tile appears in HEYEX, but clicking
it shows the WebView2 error *"Hmm, can't reach this page"*. The log
`C:\HEYEX\LogFiles\MCAshvinsWorkstation.verbose.log` contains:

```
MiiiDcmFile constructor error, couldn't open file
  \\ec2amaz-uim0t5t\ImagwPool\MC1\3\11\<N>\<timestamp>.<rand>.dcm
  for reading
  error, message was: The system cannot find the path specified
  at MC.StudyManager.Documents.MCFDocumentsPanel.ThreadLoadDICOMReport
```

**Root cause:** HEYEX holds an in-memory path record (cached by `MCAshvinsWorkstation`)
that points to a slot (`\<N>\`) that no longer exists — either the input DICOM was moved
to `UVOBackup\…\DeleteImage-Done\` or the path was stale from before the AppWay Link
wrote the result into a different slot. The SQL Anywhere DB (`dbsrv17`) and the
workstation process get out of sync after long uptime sessions.

**The result file itself is fine** — it was written correctly to disk by AppWay Link.
Only the pointer HEYEX uses to open it on click is wrong.

**Fix — try in order (fastest → most disruptive):**

1. **Restart just `MCAshvinsWorkstation.exe`** (closes the HEYEX GUI and reopens it —
   ~30 s, no service interruption):

   ```bash
   # From the backend EC2 via SSM:
   python3 scripts/ssm_run.py --instance heyex2 - << 'EOF'
   Stop-Process -Name "MCAshvinsWorkstation" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
   Start-Process "C:\HEYEX\MCAshvinsWorkstation.exe"
   EOF
   ```

   After the GUI restarts, wait ~10 s and click the result tile again.
   This clears the in-memory path cache; the tile should open correctly.

2. **Restart the core HEYEX services** (if step 1 doesn't help — flushes the DB
   connection pool as well, ~2 min):

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/ssm_run.py --instance heyex2 - << 'EOF'
   # Stop
   Stop-Process -Name "MCAshvinsWorkstation","MCAshvinsViewer" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   Stop-Service -Name "MCUVOService","MCImportNTService","MCDicomNTService" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   Start-Sleep -Seconds 5

   # Restart SQL Anywhere (clears the DB path cache)
   Restart-Service -Name "SQLANYs_EOL_HEYEX" -Force

   Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

   # Restart HEYEX services
   Start-Service -Name "MCDicomNTService","MCImportNTService","MCUVOService"
   Start-Process "C:\HEYEX\MCAshvinsWorkstation.exe"
   EOF
   ```

3. **Full EC2 reboot** (guaranteed fix, ~3 min):

   ```bash
   aws ec2 reboot-instances --instance-ids i-02a7dd1797d85a099
   # Wait ~3 min, then verify SSM is back:
   aws ssm describe-instance-information \
     --filters "Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02a7dd1797d85a099" \
     --query 'InstanceInformationList[0].PingStatus' --output text
   ```

**Confirmed occurrence:** 2026-05-17/18 — job `final-5f1e35fa-3397-4604-b5c1-a7785919ea13`.
Result (`\MC1\3\11\30\…q11rqjd2.gfp.dcm`, 325 KB) was stored correctly on disk.
After reboot the tile opened without error. ✓

> **Note to Heidelberg:** We asked Rouven (2026-05-18) whether there is an official
> cache-flush API or HEYEX CLI command shorter than a full service restart. Will update
> this section once we hear back.
